## From the Duckett HTML book:

1. Chapter 3: “Lists” 
   * There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types:
      1. Ordered lists  are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number. 
      2. Unordered lists  are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).
      3. Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

2. Chapter 13: “Boxes”  
    * Box take tqo dimension :width, height
    * we can limt width & height win min and max value.
    * Border, margin & Padding;
      1. Border :Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.
      2. Margin Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.
      3. Padding Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.
    * It is possible to hide elements using the display and  visibility properties.
    * You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.

## From the Duckett JS book:
Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” 
* SWITCH STATEMENTS :A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.
* TYPE COERCION & WEAK TYPING :If you use a data type JavaScript did not expect, it tries to make sense of the operation rather than report an error
* SHORT CIRCUIT VALUES :Logical operators are processed left to right. They short-circuit (stop) as soon as they have a result - but they return the value that stopped the processing (not necessarily true or fa1se)
* Loops:
  1. For loop: if we need to run code specfic number of times we use for loop , in for loop the condition is usually countar which is used to tell how many times the loop should run.

  2. While loop: if we don't know how many times the code should run , we use while loop. the condition can be something other the counter.

  3. do while loop:it is very similar to the while loop, but has one key difference: it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once , even if the condition evaluates to false.
