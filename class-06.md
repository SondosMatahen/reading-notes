2. Chapter 5: “Document Object Model” (pp.183-242)
  * The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.
  * As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page. The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory. It consists of four main types of nodes.
  * Each node is an object with methods and properties. 
  * When a DOM method can return more than one element, it returns a Nodelist (even if it only finds one matching element).
