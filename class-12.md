1. Chart.js API 
    * Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. 
    * tâ€™s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more.
    * We can actually pass some options to the chart via the Line method.

    * data for pie chart is a little different to the line chart because the pie chart is simpler, we just need to supply a value and a color for each section.

2. Basic usage
  *  the <canvas> element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high.
  * The <canvas> element can be styled just like any normal image
  * Providing fallback content is very straightforward: just insert the alternate content inside the <canvas> element.
  * The <canvas> element creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more rendering contexts,
 
 
3. Drawing shapes with canvas
  * Normally 1 unit in the grid corresponds to 1 pixel on the canvas. The origin of this grid is positioned in the top left corner at coordinate (0,0)
  * All elements are placed relative to this origin.
  * fillRect(x, y, width, height) :Draws a filled rectangle. 
  * strokeRect(x, y, width, height):Draws a rectangular outline.
  * clearRect(x, y, width, height): Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.

4. Applying styles and colors
  * If we want to apply colors to a shape, there are two important properties we can use: fillStyle and strokeStyle.
  * color is a string representing a CSS <color>, a gradient object, or a pattern object. We'll look at gradient and pattern objects later. By default, the stroke and fill color are set to black (CSS color value #000000).
  * we can also draw semi-transparent (or translucent) shapes. This is done by either setting the globalAlpha property or by assigning a semi-transparent color to the stroke and/or fill style.

5. Drawing text
  * fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth]) :Fills a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.  
  * strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth]) :Strokes a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
